# 📚 Personal Learning Hub  
*A structured and evolving collection of my learning notes, code experiments, and project summaries.*

Welcome to my personal learning repository — a curated knowledge base where I document my journey in technology, programming, and beyond. This space serves as both a reference for myself and a transparent showcase of my continuous growth for collaborators, peers, or anyone interested in my learning path.

## 📖 What’s Inside?
- **Study Notes**: Organized notes from courses, books, articles, and tutorials.
- **Code Snippets & Experiments**: Hands-on practice code, algorithm implementations, and small projects.
- **Project Summaries**: Key takeaways and reflections from personal or collaborative projects.
- **Cheatsheets & Guides**: Quick-reference materials for tools, languages, and frameworks.

## ✨ Features
- 📁 **Topic-based Organization**: Cleanly structured by domain (e.g., `machine-learning/`, `web-development/`, `systems-design/`).
- 🔍 **Search-Friendly**: Clear naming and `README.md` files in each directory for easy navigation.
- 🧩 **Modular & Reusable**: Many examples and notes are designed to be adapted in real projects.
- 📈 **Progress Tracking**: Regular updates reflect ongoing learning and deepening understanding.

## 🗂️ Main Categories
- `Programming-Languages/` – Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.
- `Frameworks-Tools/` – React, Docker, TensorFlow, and more.
- `Computer-Science/` – Algorithms, data structures, OS, networks.
- `Soft-Skills/` – Communication, productivity, project management.
- `Languages/` – English, Chinese study notes.
